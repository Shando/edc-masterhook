[emu:c4pc]
name=C4PC
Notes=This emulator is not intended to be used to PLAY / RUN / USE, but to TEST Cybiko software with. Only experienced Cybiko software developers should use this software. The emulation is very unstable and does NOT represent the Cybiko device/games/apps in any way. Hence, many games/apps don't work, which isn't the case on a REAL Cybiko.
